Feature: Train OSDR recordset


# container
Scenario: Train recordset choosed by full id
   Given I want to train recordset
     And set valid full id
     And set valid folder          
     And set valid metadata file
    When I run the command
    Then I get new folder

Scenario: Train recordset choosed by part id
   Given I want to train recordset
     And set valid part id
     And set valid folder          
     And set valid metadata file
    When I run the command
    Then I get new folder

Scenario: Train recordset choosed by part name
   Given I want to train recordset
     And set valid part name
     And set valid folder         
     And set valid metadata file
    When I run the command
    Then I get new folder

# meta
Scenario Outline: Train recordset with valid meta
   Given I want to train recordset
     And set valid full id
     And set valid <folder>          
     And set valid <metadata> file
    When I run the command
    Then I get <folder>

    Examples: Metadata files
     | metadata                      |  folder           |
     | sample_files/train_valid.json |  train_valid.json |
     | sample_files/train_valid.yaml |  train_valid.yaml |

Scenario Outline: Train recordset with invalid meta
   Given I want to train recordset
     And set valid full id
     And set valid folder          
     And set invalid <metadata> file
    When I run the command
    Then I get error message

    Examples: Metadata files
     | metadata                  |
     | sample_files/invalid.json |
     | sample_files/invalid.yaml |
     | any-file.txt              |
